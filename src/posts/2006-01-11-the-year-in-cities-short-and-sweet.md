<p>Following <a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/01/the-year-in-cities">Kottke's post</a>, here's a picture of 2005 in cities:</p>
<p>Washington DC *<br />
Philadelphia PA *<br />
Columbus OH *<br />
Syracuse NY *<br />
Duck NC<br />
Charlottesville VA<br />
Cerrillos NM (near Santa Fe)</p>
<p>One or more nights spent in each place. Those cities marked with an * were visited multiple times on non-consecutive days. Short and sweet. *'s are basically family, and the rest were vacations.</p>
