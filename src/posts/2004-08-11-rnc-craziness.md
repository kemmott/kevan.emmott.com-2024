<p>So with all this security buildup around NYC for the RNC, they are starting to do lots of searches, etcâ€¦</p>
<p>This guy got searched boarding a ferry and told that his BOOK (a role-playing - a la D&amp;D - sourcebook) <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/mephron/349969.html">had to be confiscated</a>.</p>
<p>We live in a f'ed up world.</p>
