<p>For only $1.3 Mil, you too can own one of the houses of <a href="http://www.dittmarrealty.com/newhomes.html">Woodlawn Manor</a>. They tore down a house that sold for a million to put two of these on the lot. Richly appointed indeed.</p>
<p>It's taking place around the block on 16th Street - we can see some of the construction from our bedroom window. I'll try and post some shots when things get interesting.</p>
