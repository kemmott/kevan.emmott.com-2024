<p>Web applications built around the idea of helping a group, project, or company get work done and communicate in a more effective manner have been around for a number of years. These collaborative tools take many shapes, some built to add a layer of interaction to a common task that currently takes place, some bringing new ideas to bear on how to manage projects or treat interaction as a whole.</p>

This raises the issue of how best to integrate these types of tools into a process methodology.</p>
