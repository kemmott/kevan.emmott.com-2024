<p>Having the news channels on all day long at work is just weird. I'm sort of tuning them out, but I know way too much about useless things happening around the world.Â  And I get to experience all those cultural memes like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeadOn">HeadOn advertisements</a>.</p>
