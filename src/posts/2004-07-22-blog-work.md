<p><a href="http://binarybonsai.com">Michael</a> is doing some ambitious <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2004/07/22/left-to-trim">work</a> on his blog. He's looking at integrating his photos and his gallery (basically his portfolio). <a href="http://rebelpixel.com/projects/ipap/">iPAP</a> was brought up as an alternative for the photos - I second the recommendation. For a simple CMS, I might look at <a href="http://www.mamboserver.com">Mambo</a>. It can handle quite a lot, but I think it can be set up pretty lightweight.</p>
<p>MY experience is certainly with the more "industrial" CMS apps (Interwoven, Vignette, Stellent, Percussion, among others) and similar third party software (Plumtree Portal, etc.), however, I'm always wishing we were dealing with a more flexible, nimble piece of software.</p>
