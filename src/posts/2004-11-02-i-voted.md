<p>I voted. This morning. Took Erin and I almost two hours <a href="http://www.co.arlington.va.us/Departments/ParksRecreation/scripts/comm_center/ParksRecreationScriptsComm_centerLangstonBrown.aspx?tab=Langston%20Brown">waiting in line</a> - good thing we had pastries from <a href="http://www.heidelbergbakery.com">Heidelberg</a>. We did have Cooper with us though - he got a little crazy by the end.</p>
