<p><a href="http://m0n0.ch/wall/index.php">m0n0wall</a> 1.1 was released very recently. From their site:</p>
<blockquote><p> m0n0wall is a project aimed at creating a complete, embedded firewall software package...</p></blockquote>
<p>Among the things I'm jazzed about:</p>
<ul>
<li>magic shaper wizard for the traffic shaper</li>
<li>SVG-based traffic grapher</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://m0n0.ch/wall/downloads.php">Get it</a> now...</p>
