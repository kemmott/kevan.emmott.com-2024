<p><em>The System of the World</em> (p. 159) strikes again:</p>
<blockquote><p>
"That is the problem, Dappa: each [letter] refers to a different [story]. It seems that if you put enough stories out before the public, many a reader will find <em>one</em> that speaks to him. But there is no telling <em>which</em>."</p>
<p>"What we've been doing, then, is a bit like firing grapeshot," Dappa mused. "Chances are that a ball will strike home&mdash;but there's no telling which&mdash;so, best fire a lot of 'em."</p>
<p>"And grapeshot is a useful tactic sometimes," Eliza said, "but it never sank a ship, did it?"</p>
<p>"No, my lady, grapeshot can never do that."</p>
<p>"I say we have now fired enough grapeshot. It has had all the effect it is ever going to have. <strong>What we need now, Dappa, is a cannonball.</strong>"
</p></blockquote>
