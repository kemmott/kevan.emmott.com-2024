<p>Dear Google,</p>
<p>Please allow me to merge my accounts. I seem to have 3, and together they make one giant clusterf***. I have my original gmail account. Then I got Google Apps For Your Domain, which has everything all laid out nicely connected to emmott.com. But then, since that doesn't seem to fly for many of your web apps, I have to have a new 3rd account, kevan.emmott, that is valid for those web apps but somehow disparate from my GAFYD account. Yet I use my GAFYD email address as the email for this third account - can you say big 'ole mess?</p>
<p>Yours, K</p>
