<p>I'm still a little too in shock to really voice my thoughts on the earthquake/tsunami. You can donate here: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/paypage/PX3BEL97U9A4I">Amazon Honor System</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon, Apple, many sites have changed their home page to reflect/provide links to resources and donation areas...</p>
<p>Some crazy pictures: <a href="http://www.waveofdestruction.org/photos/albums.html">waveofdestruction.org</a><br />
