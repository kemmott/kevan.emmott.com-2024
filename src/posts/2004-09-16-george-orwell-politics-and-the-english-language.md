<p>From George Orwell's essay, "<a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm">Politics and the English Language</a>," 1946</p>
<p>Must strive to meet these rules:</p>
<blockquote><p>
1. Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.</p>
<p>2. Never us a long word where a short one will do.</p>
<p>3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.</p>
<p>4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.</p>
<p>5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.</p>
<p>6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.
