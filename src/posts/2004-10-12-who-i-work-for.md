<p>Well, I work for <a href="http://www.sra.com">SRA</a>. But I'm currently working for them on site at <a href="http://www.pbgc.gov">PBGC</a>. The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com">Post</a> has a good <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25334-2004Oct11.html">article</a> about the troubles they're facing.</p>
<p>But what am I <em>doing</em>? My title is <strong>System Architect</strong>, which doesn't mean much. Currently, we're implementing and extending/developing apps for a portal for their intranet, using <a href="http://www.plumtree.com">Plumtree</a>, and redoing their public internat site using a <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS, <a href="http://www.percussion.com">Percussion Rhythmyx</a>.</acronym></p>
