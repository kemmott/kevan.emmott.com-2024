<p>So administering wordpress is no difficult task, but I'm glad I finally took the time to get moved to it (especially this new version). Next up is to change the css/layout, and maybe mess around with plugins such as <a href="http://alexking.org">Alex King</a>'s WP-Photo (when he converts it to 1.2).</p>
<p><em>(note: technically, I'm moving BACK to wordpress, since I used b2 "back-in-the-day" and set up some wp .72 era sites...)</em></p>
