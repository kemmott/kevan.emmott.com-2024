<p>So I've jotted down little mini one-line reviews of some movies we've seen. In the future, I'll just make those individual posts tagged "movie". For now, here's the ones I've done in the past:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356721/">I (heart) huckabees</a> - quite odd, not sure where they thought they were going with this.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0366551/">Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle</a> - excellent, if absurd and stupid as this type of movie always is. A next gen Office Space + Dazed and Confused + Holy Grail/Quest movie.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364725/">Dodgeball</a> - quite funny, a farce, great cameos (Chuck Norris, Lance Armstrong, etc.), quote- and meme-able (ESPN 8, "The Ocho"), good time</li>
<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0333766/">Garden State</a> - great, fun, touching, quirky - gives Zach Braff a lot of credibility in Tinseltown</li>
</ul>
