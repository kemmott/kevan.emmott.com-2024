<p><a href="http://www.pointlesswasteoftime.com/games/manifesto.html">A Gamers' Manifesto</a> - awesome treatise on the state of gaming...</p>
<blockquote><p>Confusing, mapless floor plans. Did you remember when you were a kid and you got bored on weekends, how you would go to a large building, a hotel or a hospital, then wander around for several hours looking for a certain room? While zombies attacked you? Neither do we. That's because, much to the surprise of FPS game makers everywhere, wandering around lost in hallways isn't fun.</p></blockquote>
