<p>So I signed up for the first <a href="http://studio.pragprog.com/">Rails Studio</a> from the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/index.html">Pragmatic Programmers</a> guys (plus the one day Ruby intro). Really looking forward to it - hopefully afterwards I can really step up my involvement with the <a href="http://www.railfrog.com/">RailFrog</a> CMS project.</p>
