<p>March Madness is upon us - Syracuse plays their opening round game tonight! I'm totally losing all brackets I'm submitting, because (as Dave Elmer - a guy I worked with at SRA - says) I'm such a homer. Doesn't matter - so I enjoy rooting for them, and actually, the only time I ever won anything like this was taking SU to win it all with Carmelo in '03.</p>
