<p>Went to James and Elisa's wedding in New Mexico, near Santa Fe. Absolutely gorgeous, and ridiculously exhausting to do with the kids. Also went into Santa Fe, went to Taos, the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge, a Sonic (yummy burger and cherry lime-ade), and the New Mexico Museum of Natural History in Albuquerque. Altitude sickness, allergies, hangovers, hella dry air, but pretty darn cool. Definitely don't wanna go back to work <strike>tomorrow</strike> today.</p>
