<p>So it turns out that maybe <a href="http://www.tompaine.com/articles/kerry_won_.php">Kerry won</a> anyway...</p>
<p>Or perhaps <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/11/03/purple_haze.html">no-one really won</a>.</p>
<p>I'd really like to see a map done that way on a <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/vote2004/countymap.htm">county scale</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: and of course someone had made one! <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~rvdb/JAVA/election2004/">Color gradation on a county scale</a>.</p>
<p>Let's keep going: the <a href="http://outlandish-josh.dailykos.com/story/2004/11/4/191246/507">18-30 vote</a> (scroll down below the "fold").</p>
<p><strong>One More Update</strong>: OK, here's the best summary of all this: <a href="http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/election/">Election result maps</a> (even wallpaper sized versions...)</p>
