<p>OK, so the new plan:</p>
<p>Cardhu the Mac mini as the web server, <em>maybe </em>running off an external firewire drive (probably the 160 GB) for size plus longevity (?).</p>
<p>Oban the 1 Ghz Athlon with FreeBSD 5.X as fileserver with 2 200 GB drives in software RAID-0 (gvinum).</p>
<p>Springbank the old fileserver goes away/becomes new testbed.</p>
<p>Knockando the 867 Mhz PB 12" becomes dev/Mac testing/used more as a laptop.</p>
<p>New mac mini gets ordered when it would come with Tiger, used with the Dell FP2005W (need a name!).</p>
<p>Cosmo the Celeron 466 desktop becomes solely for Erin's work and a 2nd browser.</p>
