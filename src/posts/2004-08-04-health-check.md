<p>Always a little funny when you get a glimpse at your vitals. My company employs several nurses as full-time staff, and regularly runs things like "Get-Fit" programs. So they came by the office to measure blood pressure, etc. for everybody who was taking part.</p>
<p>When they were done, they offered to measure the <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003398.htm">blood pressure</a> of anyone else in the office who might want it - "Oh sure," we said. Not too bad - 110/65.</p>
<p>As I said to <a href="http://www.vhfrecords.com">Bill</a>, my standard routine is paying off. Hah. It would best be described as "everything in moderation".</p>
