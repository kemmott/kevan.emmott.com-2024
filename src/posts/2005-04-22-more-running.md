<p>Good grief. Took me long enough to go again. Slowed the pace a bit - same distance (a mile and a quarter maybe), eleven minutes "clock-to-clock" - i.e. I look right before I step out the door, run, have a cool down section, and walk inside and look again. Last time was 9 minutes I think, and I was HURTING. Not so bad now, but we'll se tomorrow. This time I just really need to get back out there sooner.</p>
