<p>(P2 is the name of the theme that the Wordpress blog you are curently reading is running. The linked article below describes the effect P2 had on their company)</p>
<p><em>It completely transformed how Automattic works internally and I think is one of the most valuable things we’ve adopted in the past year. I’m on the road a lot, and sometimes my only connection is checking the mobile-optimized P2 on my iPhone.</em></p>
<p><em>I’m excited about P2 partly because blogs provide an incredibly robust infrastructure on which to build more advanced apps and this is a good example of that.</em></p>
