<blockquote>The goal of a terrorist is to cause terror. Last week's arrests demonstrate how real security doesn't focus on possible terrorist tactics, but on the terrorists themselves.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>And if you want to know what you can do to help? Don't be terrorized.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>If we refuse to be terrorized, then they lose -- even if their attacks succeed.</p></blockquote>
