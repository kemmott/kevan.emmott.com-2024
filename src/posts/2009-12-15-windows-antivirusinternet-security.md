<div id="_mcePaste" style="position:absolute;left:-10000px;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;">Norton used to do a good job but slow your system down a bunch. They worked on performance lately, however, it is kind of like a protection racket - you always have to be up to date and paying the policeman.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position:absolute;left:-10000px;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;">Two free ones that do a very good job that a lot of people recommend:</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position:absolute;left:-10000px;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;">AVG Free</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position:absolute;left:-10000px;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;">http://free.avg.com/us-en/homepage</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position:absolute;left:-10000px;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;">ClamWin</div>

<div id="_mcePaste" style="position:absolute;left:-10000px;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;">Some people run them together, some just run one.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position:absolute;left:-10000px;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;">That said, I don't run security/anti-virus on any of the Windows machines at our house:</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position:absolute;left:-10000px;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;">a) Erin's work laptop (and mine, if I bring it home) has something corporate on it, so that doesn't count</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position:absolute;left:-10000px;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;">b) Nothing "mission critical" is on a Windows PC for us, so there's less risk</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position:absolute;left:-10000px;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;">c) just having the computers behind the FIOS router, assuming you didn't go in and open it up wide (it comes fairly protected by default) gives you a lot of protection against external attacks</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position:absolute;left:-10000px;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;">d) I don't use Internet Explorer unless I absolutely have to (for example, State Farm's website used to only work on IE) - Google Chrome or Firefox, kept up to date, provides a ton of security re: Internet attacks</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position:absolute;left:-10000px;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;">e) I'm smart about the things I open (files sent from others via Email, weird websites, etc.)</div>
<p>A friend asked if I had any input on Windows Antivirus Software, or Internet Security in general. I fired off this email in response.</p>
