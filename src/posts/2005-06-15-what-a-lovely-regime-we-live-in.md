<p><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/jlassen/186474.html">This guy</a> created some collage/remix style art of Bush and guns, in response to a Secret Service visit to an art gallery with a similar exhibit. Let's just say he got a visit himself - can you say "chilling effect"?</p>
<p>Well, I was all set to put up some similar images, but I just couldn't stand looking at a picture of Bushie in the first place. Blech - made me wanna hurl.</p>
