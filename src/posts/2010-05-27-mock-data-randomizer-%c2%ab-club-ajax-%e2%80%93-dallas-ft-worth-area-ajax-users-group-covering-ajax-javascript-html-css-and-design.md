<p>Good testing utility script for building out random data.</p>
<p>"A common step in the development cycle is to substitute fake data until real data is created, generated, or the API is set up to retrieve it. Creating this fake data isn’t usually difficult, but it can be a tedious and repetitive task. Club AJAX has added a new library item to create mock data for use in application development. Using the Club AJAX Randomizer, you can easily generate random numbers, booleans, colors, dates, characters, words, sentences, titles, names, and even website names. Helper functions are also available to scramble or return random elements from your own data."</p>
