<p>Neal Stephenson speaks my language. This one is from <em>The System of the World</em> (hardcover, p.16).</p>
<blockquote><p>
He guessed that people who had lived right and arranged things properly must have it all rigged so that all their quests ran in parallel, and reinforced and supported one another just so. They gained reputations as conjurors. Others found their errands running at cross purposes and were never able to do anything; they ended up seeming mad, or else perceived the futility of what they were doing and gave up, or turned to drink.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I bet the guys at <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">43folders</a> would like that.</p>
