<p>A bunch of interesting stuff about del.icio.us, with a great quote about UI design: <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2004/12/03/a_delicious_interview.html">Rands In Repose: A Del.icio.us Interview</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
How do you approach user interface design?<br />
<em>Lots and lots of iterations until something feels right. Avoiding features until the interface for them is apparent. Seeing how users use the existing features to do things I didn't expect, and then making those things easier.</em>
