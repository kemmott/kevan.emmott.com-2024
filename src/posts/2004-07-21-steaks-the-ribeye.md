<p>Erik <a href="http://nslog.com/archives/2004/07/20/qotd_steak.php">asks</a> about steak. This is an easy one. The Ribeye. Flavorful, marbled, a great cut. I like it done simply, I like it with strong sauces or marinades. It usually has enough character to stand on its own - even with something like a Blackened Cajun treatment, the meat itself comes from.</p>
<p>This leads into another question, and the answer is: <a href="http://www.washingtonian.com/dining/Profiles/rayssteaks.html">Ray's the Steaks</a>, in Arlington. My favorite steakhouse due to its simplicity and focus on the food. He uses a fairly lean Hereford, and butchers on site. Just excellent.</p>
