<p>Just got the 320 GB WD drive in (the largest single drive I've owned), and hooked it up. Right now, here's what's being backed up to it:</p>
<p>Desktop home folder daily<br />
Server home folder daily<br />
Sites folder daily<br />
iTunes and iPhoto libraries weekly<br />
Quicken files weekly<br />
Misc file server files monthly</p>
