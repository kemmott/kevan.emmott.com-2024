<p>Sorry about what is totally turning into just a linklist. The none of you that come here regularly must be wondering what's up.</p>
<p>On one front, Cooper got tonsillectomy and adenoid removal surgery today (yeah, way suxx0rzed for the little guy). Poor kid, we love him so much and it just tears at your heart to hear/see him feeling so bad. The ENT says it all went well and that the bleeding was really light - he is totally being a trooper. Grandma Hope came in today, though - that should help us in the caregiving world.</p>
<p>On another front, lets just say jobs in general suck. And in the specific, they suck hard. Perhaps something will change regarding this sometime soon, but who knows.</p>
