<p>Kind of distressing this evening. Looked down and realized I was taking a regular drugstore's worth of pills - two ibuprofen (which is less than I often take), one multivitamin (this new one has ginko and ginseng!), one claritin generic (antihistamine), and one sudafed twelve hour (decongestant). Fuckin' hate allergies.</p>
