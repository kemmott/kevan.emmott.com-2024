<p>Upgraded to WP 2 - I'm figuring that I won't see too many issues since I was running a pretty basic install.</p>
<p>And I'm trying out K2 - nice job <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/">Michael</a> and <a href="http://chrisjdavis.org/">Chris</a>. I know it's an included style, but damn if "vader" doesn't look cool.</p>
