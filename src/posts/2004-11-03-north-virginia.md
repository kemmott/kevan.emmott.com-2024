<p>Halley says what I've been thinking the past four years: <a href="http://halleyscomment.blogspot.com/2004/11/not-so-united-states.html">Halley's Comment: The Not So United States</a>. While we're at it, lets split Virginia into North and South. Or maybe East/West? Let Richmond and the Tidewater come too?</p>
<p>All I know, is I'm embarassed and scared.</p>
