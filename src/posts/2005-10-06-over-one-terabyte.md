<p>Holy, um, crap. Yeah, so I just got the <a href="/2005/10/06/final-piece-of-the-backup-puzzle">backup drive set up</a>, and decided to count through the storage at my house. Here's the breakdown (only drives over 10 GB counted)</p>
<p>Mac Desktop (80 GB Main and 160 GB iLife and Games) 240 GB<br />
PC Desktop 30 GB<br />
Mac Laptop 40 GB<br />
PC HTPC 40 GB<br />
FreeBSD Dev Server 30 GB<br />
Mac File Server (40 GB Main/Website and 400 GB files and 320 GB Backup) 760 GB</p>
<p>(Oh, and 2 iPods - 20 and 40 GB)</p>
<p>Total: 1200 GB, or <strong>Over One Terabyte</strong>.</p>
