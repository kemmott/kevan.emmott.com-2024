<p>Just quickly - the web and database now lives on cardhu, the FreeBSD box, along with qmail and Courier - no longer on oban, the Win2k box. As part of this whole hullaballoo, I moved to php5, and new versions of SquirrelMail and Gallery (drawn from ports - that and cvsup make FreeBSD ROCK.)</p>
<p>The net net for most people - both the regular gallery and the friends gallery are on new versions, with new "skins"...</p>
