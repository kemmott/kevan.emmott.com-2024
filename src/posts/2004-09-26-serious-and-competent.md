<p>Truer words were never spoken - from Neal Stephenson's <em>Quicksilver</em> (p. 407):</p>
<blockquote><p>
"...It may seem hard for you to believe, but mark my word&mdash;whenever serious and competent people need to get things done in the real world, all considerations of tradition and protocol fly out the window."
</p></blockquote>
<p>It might be his character <a href="http://www.metaweb.com/wiki/wiki.phtml?title=Stephenson:Neal:Quicksilver:Jack_Shaftoe">Jack Shaftoe</a> speaking, but that sure is telegraphed directly to the reader...</p>
