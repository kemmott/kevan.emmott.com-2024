<p>Keith Olbermann, being justifiably scathing: <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2006/10/18/countdown-special-comment-death-of-habeas-corpus-your-words-are-lies-sir/">Crooks and Liars » Countdown Special Comment: Death of Habeas Corpus: “Your words are lies, Sir.”</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Your words are lies, Sir.</p>
<p>They are lies, that imperil us all.</p>
<p>"One of the terrorists believed to have planned the 9/11 attacks," …you told us yesterday… "said he hoped the attacks would be the beginning of the end of America."</p>
<p>That terrorist, sir, could only hope.</p>
<p>Not his actions, nor the actions of a ceaseless line of terrorists (real or imagined), could measure up to what you have wrought.</p>
<p>Habeas Corpus? Gone.</p>
<p>The Geneva Conventions? Optional.</p>
<p>The Moral Force we shined outwards to the world as an eternal beacon, and inwards at ourselves as an eternal protection? Snuffed out.</p>
<p>These things you have done, Mr. Bush… they would be "the beginning of the end of America."</p></blockquote>
