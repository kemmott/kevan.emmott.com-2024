<p>Another nice line from Neal Stephenson's book (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>
"I am certain that in the fullness of time, the opinion I have just voiced will be wide spread among learned persons," Daniel said. "This may not however elevate your stature during the years you have remaining; <strong>for fame's a weed, but repute is a slow-growing oak, and all we can do during our lifetimes is hop around like squirrels and plant acorns.</strong>"
</p></blockquote>
