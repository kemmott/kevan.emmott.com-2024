<p>So I switched projects at work - and I ended up working on an Air Force project at the Pentagon. Probably not what my parents expected, and I'm sure not what my high school teachers (at the Quaker K-12 school I attended) would have guessed. Lots of security clearance/classified stuff, pass swiping, a significant amount of money (like everyone in my entire area is sitting in an <a href="http://www.dwr.com/productdetail.cfm?id=1811">Aeron Chair</a>), and boatloads of acronyms... technically, for example, I'm doing work for AF/CVAC, in the CRC, which is next to the CAT, all inside the RSAC. Anyways, I just read this NPR article: <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5634985">A (Nearly) All-Access Pentagon Pass</a>, which captures some of the feel of the place, including Rumsfeld telling a "joke": "You know why a yuppie can't say the Pledge of Allegiance?" I won't spoil the punchline for ya.</p>
